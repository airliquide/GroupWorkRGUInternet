====================

KarokYT is an experimental web application combining music videos from youtube and lyrics found on other websites (currently only lyrics.com). It was made for an assignment in which we simply had to demonstrate the use of 2 or more web APIs.

What makes KaraokYT slightly different is that the second API used (in addition to YouTube's) is actually an homebrew API. This API is the one that fetches the lyrics. It was the only viable solution we had at the moment, since most lyrics websites APIs are either not free or don't deliver the full lyrics.
